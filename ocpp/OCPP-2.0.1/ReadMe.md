### Additional information

For historical reasons not all documents have the same release date. OCPP 2.0.1 Edition 3 is the same as OCPP 2.0.1 Edition 2 including all errata up and until OCPP-2.0.1_edition2_errata_2024-04 (2024-04-30).

The errata do not affect any schemas of OCPP messages. The errata do contain changes to requirements or even new requirements,
but only in cases where a requirement contains an obvious error and would not or could not be implemented literally. New 
requirements were only added when they were already implicitly there. These changes have been discussed in or were proposed by 
the Technology Working Group of the Open Charge Alliance.

The appendices of the OCPP 2.0.1 part 2 can be updated without requiring a new OCPP release. This mainly concerns the
components and variables of the OCPP device model, which can be extended with new components or variables, as long as they
are optional.
